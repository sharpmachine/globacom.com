...What do they have in common?

Solution:

Problem:

of travelling all the time to talk with its partner locally. Globacom’s Solutions makes it faster

front and two support areas:

...And now:

The Bundeskanzler Herkel is using Globacom’s Executive Shield Phone, which exceeding 

all level of international intelligence gathering, because the call Setup is out of Switzerland to 

both parties, the Swiss law of Telecommunication which is same like the Swiss bank secrets, 

allows us to deal safer. 

Chairman John Ming get contacted by his Chief Security Officer, to flee in the North, because 

they get the information of an new earthquake which will happen in Tokio. Chief Security 

Officer Mark Smart can track his Chairman with the Globatrack, he can see any Executives 

of his Company on the World map. Globatrack is not an Itinerary tracker it is a real time-
online Tracker with additional Features like battery level indicator, Panic Button etc. 

Bill Zuckerberg is using his I-Pad to start the Video-Multi conferencing with his People, while 

he is waiting on his flight. He can ask all questions, because he knows with GlobaVideo 

he has the safest way of Communication. GlobaVideo makes a VPN-Tunnel between our 

Datacenter, which is in Switzerland, and each device that is furthermore Pin- and Password-
Protected. Philippe More his Chief Marketing Officer will send him on time his presentation 

of the new product. This data’s are crucial, thats why he is using GlobaCloud that is the right 

vault System for those data’s.

What people are saying?
