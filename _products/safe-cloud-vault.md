    technical_details: |
      <p>SwissSSL is Swiss made. The certification authorities' (CA) software is based on Swiss software and is developed and operated in Switzerland. Globacom Ltd aims to conduct all support work and services with Swiss companies. Until now, this has been extremely difficult in the area of SSL certificates. This is because virtually all (including German) certification authorities (CAs) are based on American root certificates. GlobaCloud is the first cloud provider that is independently Swiss.</p>
