    technical_details: |
      <p>SwissSSL is Swiss made: the certification authorities (CA) software is based on Swiss software and is developed and run in Switzerland. Globacom Ltd aims to conduct all support work and services with Swiss companies. Until now, this has been extremely difficult if not impossible in the area of SSL certificates. This is because almost all (including German) certification authorities (CAs) are based sooner or later on American root certificates. GlobaCloud is the first Cloud- Provider to go the Swiss way.</p>
